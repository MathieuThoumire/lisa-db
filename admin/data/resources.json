It is built using the organizational framework provided by the foundational Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It uses an abstract biomedical layer on top of that - OBO-UBO which has been constructed as a proposal to the OBO Foundry. This is meant to support creating a sharable view of core biomedical objects such as biomaterial_entity, and organismal_entity that all biomedical ontologies are likely to need and want to use with the same intended meaning. The BIRNLex biomaterial entities have already been factored to separately maintained ontology - BIRNLexBiomaterialEntity.owl which this BIRNLex-Main.owl file imports. The Ontology of Biomedical Investigation (OBI) is also imported and forms the foundation for the formal description of all experiment-related artifacts. The BIRNLex will serve as the basis for construction of a formal ontology for the multiscale investigation of neurological disease.",

The ontology describes the basic Steps of the experimentation protocol (Directed Activities, Semi-directed Activities and Free Discussion with the Clinician), the Tasks that are involved, as well as the measurement types relevant to each Task. The defined protocol can be reused and further extended, adding new steps, tasks and measured data.

Cognitive neuroscience aims to map mental processes onto brain function, which begs the question of what \"mental processes\" exist and how they relate to the tasks that are used to manipulate and measure them. We propose that cumulative progress in cognitive neuroscience requires a more systematic approach to representing the mental entities that are being mapped to brain function and the tasks used to manipulate and measure mental processes.",

FRAPO is not intended to describe the details of research investigations enabled by funded research projects, nor their component studies and assays, which are the domain of a complementary ontology, ISA-RDF (under development - add URL).",

The ontology is based on the Basic Formal Ontology, and adheres to the MIREOT principles.",

      "Description": "The OPB is an ontology of the real entities and their abstractions modeled using the science of classical physics for the description and analyisis of physical entities such as an apple or rope, or for systems of interacting entities. It includes branches of engineering system dynamics and classical thermodynamics. OPB has been formulated to support the development, annotation, description and sharing of analytical models. Although developed in the domain of biology, biophysics and physiology, its underlying assumptions, form and content is applicable for the analysis of non-biological engineering systems. OPB aims to facilitate and expedite the annotation and cross-referencing of physics-based analytical models in the broad realm of biomedicine. In curating the OPB, we have strived to represent biophysical knowledge of applicable to biological physical entities, processes, and functions using the formal tools and concepts of computational ontology as expressed in description logic (DL),and web ontology language (OWL). OPB has classes that represent abstractions of key classes in BFO such as BFO:Continuant (OPB:Physics continuant). BFO:Processural entity (OPB:Processural entity), and BFO:Attribute (OPB:Physics attribute). A key differentiator is that OPB represents physical entities not represented in BFO such thermodynamic energy, potential energy fields, information. In particular, OPB:Physical process ia defined as the flow of energy and/or information amongst process participants. These are essential concepts for explaining, understanding and testing of biophysical hypotheses. To emphasize intent of the OPB as an ontology of analytical concepts, we have purposely named its top class and its subclasses using the term \"Physics\" to reference the science of physics rather than the term \"physical\" which could imply that OPB intends to represent the \"real\" physical world. The OPB does not extend to include quantum or relativistic physics, nor is it intended to recapitulate the axiomatic basis of physics as a theoretical framework. Rather, OPB is focuses on foundational theory of classical physics particularly as applied in system dynamics. For example, it encompasses discrete systems analysis (using ordinary differential equations; ODEs), continuum systems analysis (using partial differential equations; PDEs), discrete \"agent-based\" modeling, and causal propagation models. the first version of the OPB is targeted solely to discrete systems analysis.",

      "OVERVIEW OF PLAN": "eg: An 8-year-old boy is referred for a psychiatric evaluation after concerns about significant distractibility and impulsive behavior that have been present for two years but have apparently worsened since the start of third grade. Parent and teacher reports, as well as clinical observation and record review, all suggest an ADHD diagnosis. The boy’s parents inquire about what accommodations they should ask the school to make for their son. Consistent with the comprehensive life-course model of care, what should be done prior to asking the school to modify instruction or testing for the child?\nFirst, foundational strategies such as parent and teacher education should be employed. Does the patient’s teacher have classroom management skills that include making behavioral expectations clear and enforcing consequences for misbehavior consistently? Do the parents and teacher have a system for communicating regularly to monitor the child’s behavior and performance over time?\nSecond, evidence-based psychosocial interventions should be attempted, to improve the child’s skills. Because school is an area of particular concern, one effective school-based psychosocial intervention for elementary-age students with ADHD is a token reinforcement system, where the child can earn tokens for appropriate behavior and loses them for misbehavior, and can exchange the tokens periodically for privileges or other primary reinforcers.\nThird, if psychosocial interventions have been implemented with fidelity and are insufficiently effective for this particular patient, medication can be initiated. Stimulant medications in particular have shown considerable efficacy in reducing levels of core symptoms in many youth with ADHD.\nIf the strategies described above do not yield gains, and particularly if the treatment provider sees evidence that the child is actually not able to access the educational program (instruction or assessments) due to ADHD symptoms, a recommendation for school-based accommodations can be considered. These accommodations would be targeted to the child’s particular pattern of needs. For instance, if the student cannot maintain attention sufficiently to complete an exam, a read-aloud accommodation may be appropriate. Importantly, even if accommodations are implemented, interventions should continue in the hopes of reducing the child’s dependence on accommodations. Moreover, the child’s response to any accommodations should be monitored, to examine both logistical feasibility and efficacy.\nIf the provider recommends an accommodation, relevant laws can be cited, but more importantly, any letter should include clear evidence showing that the child meets the formal criteria for ADHD, is functionally limited, and is unable to access the educational program at present.

Our technology first identifies a human face in real time or in an image or video. Computer vision algorithms identify key landmarks on the face – for example, the corners of your eyebrows, the tip of your nose, the corners of your mouth. Deep learning algorithms then analyze pixels in those regions to classify facial expressions. Combinations of these facial expressions are then mapped to emotions.",

This neuropsychological online ADHD test makes a complete cognitive screening and evaluates the risk index for ADHD by taking into account the user’s cognitive strengths and weaknesses. This ADHD assessment also determines the subtype of ADHD: Inattentive (ADD) or hyperactive-impulsive predominance (ADHD). This ADHD test is appropriate for kids 7+, teens, and adults. Anyone can easily use this online ADHD neuropsychological evaluation.",

Data collection targets were established with this goal in mind by the EXAMINER advisory panel, NINDS focus groups, NINDS Project Officer and the UCSF team. Piloting and ongoing data collection were conducted utilizing the large research infrastructure at UCSF and in collaboration with nine remote sites to represent a full range of geographic regions, ethnic groups, age groups and diagnostic disorders. The project lasted five years, from December 2006 through 2010. ",

Having a conversation will help us to help you formulate a successful project.

This is important because it means that our notifications will be delivered regardless of whether a participant has an internet connect. Yes, we have a very flexible scheduling system that is best fully understood through a demo. It can handle simple and complex scenarios. Yes, when a participant taps on the notification it takes them immediately into the session of questions.\nA demo is best for seeing all of this and understanding the functionality but there is a list on our website which covers it at a basic level: https://www.lifedatacorp.com/features/\nWe have configurable dashboards to view individual and group data, plus response rates, etc. You can also download the data in several formats in .csv. A demo will help you to understand this.\nYes, that is correct. We need to discuss your team’s needs for me to be able to fully quote you.\nYes. https://www.lifedatacorp.com/lifedata-privacy-policy/\nYes. Encrypted in transit and at rest in multiple ways. We are HIPAA, GDPR, and Privacy Shield compliant.\nParticipants cannot directly delete their own data. You can delete your entire data set when you are done with the study and done downloading any data you need.\nYes, as noted above.\nNo. This is a cloud solution. We use Azure cloud services and all servers are located in the US.\nYou may create your questions in just about any language and collect your responses in just about any language.

Researchers cannot download Ethica and set it up themselves (as it is with Beiwe) but they can request the service to be installed on their own server. We already have clients who use Ethica for larger projects outside North America and have installed Ethica on their local servers.\"\n\n11/5/2020 email: \"1. We do not officially provide an API, though we do share our API documentation with a few of our clients (it's based on REST & GraphQL)\n2. To be specific about the encryption, the data is encrypted at rest, it is not end-to-end encrypted. Only our two system administrators who have direct access to our servers can access the data, and these two individuals can read any data stored on Ethica servers. You can find a lot more details in our \"Ethica Software Development and Security Practices\" document I shared in the previous email.\"\n\nEarlier email: \"You can certainly use Ethica to administer your surveys like this. In fact, we offer many more features when it comes to customization which allows you to tailor the behavior of the project based on participants' context.

      "contact": "10/29/2020 email:\n\n1. Where can I find a full list of features (customizing mobile questionnaires, user response options, etc.)?\nSee attached 1-page summary document. A few recent platform updates not captured in (Instant Messaging with Study Participants, Forthcoming Integration with ~300 wearable devices/trackers/apps)\n\n2. How would I schedule push notifications to 1,000s of otherwise anonymous users enrolled in a study who have installed your mobile app on their phones?\nThis can be done using triggers. Triggers allow you to target and engage study participants base on time of day, location and activity. Here is an example of what the UI for a time-based trigger looks like:\ntime-based trigger.gif\n\n\n3. How would I score/visualize/analyze data?\nMetricwire provides tools for scoring assessments, coding & transforming data. You can export your data in CSV format or via API. \n\n4. How long can I keep collecting and storing data?  Are there data quotas?\nYou can collect data for as long as you have an active licence. There are no per participant limits on the amount of data you can collect within your licence. \n\n5. Would I pay for an admin license and would the 1,000s of study participants access the mobile app for free?\nCorrect. The mobile applications are free for study participants and a paid admin licence is needed to build and deploy studies.\n\n6. Are data encrypted on the phone or on your servers?\nYes. We use AES-256 encryption when storing data on the mobile device and in the database. \n\n7. Can respondents delete data they've submitted, or can I delete respondents' data from your servers?\nRespondents cannot delete their responses via the mobile application. The research team owns and controls all participant data and can delete the data at any time. Metricwire has no commercial interest in your data. \n\n\nCan you add pictures/audio/video to questions? You can add pictures/audio/video/PDF docs and embed websites\nCan you do conditional/skip logic? Yes. Within/across assessments you can use conditional/skip logic. You can also trigger entirely new schedules based on response patterns. For example, If Stress > 8, deliver follow up assessments hourly for 3 hours. \nAre respondents able to record audio or draw? You can capture audio/video/images from participants. Currently no drawing capabilities but this could be incorporated. E.g. we have had recent requests for drawing on top of images (circle pain on body image). ",

Did you do both of those steps? Because if not, then the system will only let you complete experiences online. It operates on an online default, offline features must be turned on.\"\n\n11/9/2020 email: \"I was able to talk to our tech lead about the offline notifications and he said that these offline notifications operate based on an alarm clock set up where the notifications are simply synched to the phone clock. I hope this answers your question but if not, please feel free to contact our tech lead, Omar, directly at omar@expiwell.com for further clarification. He will probably be more helpful on that matter.\"\n\n11/5/2020 email: \"1. Is end-to-end encryption possible? Could anyone at your company access any response data?\nWe do not use end-to-end encryption for our response data. ExpiWell employees will be able to see the response data, but it is aggregated. The only time we are looking at specific response data is when troubleshooting. That's rare though as most issues will be located elsewhere like pulling up the participant's experience schedule.\n\n2. Can a user receive offline (local OS) notifications as well?\nUsers can receive offline notifications as well. This is only if the participant has selected the project to be taken as offline. However, Android will send an offline notification if it doesn't receive the online push notification.\n\n3. Could a researcher set up your system on their own (for example, hospital) servers, or would they have to use your SaaS?\nWe are a SaaS product and there is no alternative at the moment for researchers to host it elsewhere\n\n4. So a researcher can make a deletion request, but does that mean they can select a user and hit \"Delete\", and these data will automatically get deleted within 8 days?\nThere is no option at this time to remove a participant from the project from your side at the researcher. You can delete their data in the output of course as well as delete any projects in full after downloading the data. Anything you delete on our servers will be deleted permanently from the database after 7 or 8 days. However, again, you cannot delete participant responses individually on the servers. \"\n\n11/4/2020 email: \"Can a user respond by entering text, draw, write a signature, or upload files? They respond with text, audio, video, and image files. There are no signature or drawing capabilities at this time. \nCan a researcher add pictures, audio, video to accompany questions? Yes, images, audio, and video can all be integrated within the assessments.\nCan a researcher add conditional logic to branch/skip questions, or add a timer/delay per question? We have logic options built in as well as skip functionality. There are no timers or delay capabilities within the survey builder right now.\n\nCan a researcher set up scoring as they build an assessment, or would they download data and analyze offline? Yes, scoring capabilities are included in the survey builder. Happy to show this on the call.\n\nBy multi-language support, I don't mean the content of questionnaires, but the app itself, such as error messages, notifications, instructions online and in the app, etc.  I take it these are in English? Correct, the app itself is all in English right now. We are currently working on a Spanish version but do not have a release date for that yet.\"\n\n11/3/2020 email: \"Can I schedule push notifications to 1,000s of users multiple times per day, week, month, or on specific dates, who have installed your mobile app on their phones?  If a user taps on the push notification, will it take the user directly to the questionnaire to which they were assigned for that time? Yes, you can schedule this way in our system and have the push notification sent through mobile phones (our app is updated in both android and iOS). Correct, if the participant taps on the notification it takes them directly into the appropriate survey. No navigation through the app would be required. \nWhere can I find a list of features (customizing mobile questionnaires, user response options, etc.)? A simple listing of features can be found on our pricing page here. \nHow do I score/visualize/analyze data? I can show the output and dashboard of the data on our call. \nWould I pay for an admin license and would the 1,000s of study participants access the mobile app for free? Yes, you would pay for an admin license via the website or an invoice. The app is free for all users. \nDo you have a privacy policy? Yes, attached below to this email and linked here for more info. \nAre data encrypted on the phone or on your servers? Data is encrypted on our servers and am confirming with our tech team about the phones. \nCan respondents delete data they've submitted, or can I delete respondents' data from your servers? I have attached our data retention policies below as well. \nCan users respond offline? Yes, offline capabilities are included in our Premium plan and must be enabled by the researcher for participants to have that option. \nCould we set it us on our own servers? Need clarification here as to what you are looking for. \nDoes it permit localization / languages? You may set the surveys in whatever language is needed. Notifications are in English. Timing of notifications are automatically set to the timezone of the participant based on their phone clock.\"",

How exactly do I schedule push notifications to 1,000s of otherwise anonymous users enrolled in a study who have installed your mobile app on their phones?\n\nYou can set the notifications per questionnaire beforehand on our platform.

This way you do not need to set the notifications for 1,000s participants individually. \n\nafbeelding.png\n\n\n3.

Of course the duration and quotas can be upgraded if the study takes longer than foreseen.\n\n5. Would I pay for an admin license and would the 1,000s of study participants access the mobile app for free?\n\nYes, use of the app is free for participants and you would pay for the admin license. \n\n6. Do you have a privacy policy?\n\nYes, we have a privacy policy. Of course we are compliant with the strict European General Data Protection Regulation and adhere to international study standards. Due to our end-to-end encryption only you have access to the filled-out questionnaires with your unique key. We at Open HealthHub cannot view the responses from the participants as they are encrypted and we do not have the decryption-key. We are ISO 27001 certifies and audited yearly.\n\n7. Can respondents delete data they've submitted, or can I delete respondents' data from your servers?\n\nRespondents cannot delete the data they have submitted to you. Using our platform you can of course obtain their consent before they answer questions. At the conclusion of the study we will delete all the data from the respondents from our servers. Of course you as study owner can always instruct us to delete the data from our servers at any time you want. \nPM: In case participants want their data deleted, they can have them removed by a special request as a part of the GDPR. \n\n[Email after registration]: \"For validation we need your setup email and BIG number.\" \nPersonal reply to an email: \"The BIG-number is the official Dutch registry number for physicians, but this is of course not applicable to you.

If you’re interested in a very robust survey platform then Beiwe likely isn’t the best option for you. However, if passive data collection is your top priority then I’m happy to set up a phone call.\n\n@:  Thank you for your reply.  I'm really just interested in comparing EMA/EMI software out there for colleagues, who have compiled a set of questions to determine Beiwe's suitability in particular for different studies.  Could you please answer the following:\n\nCan I schedule push notifications to 1,000s of users multiple times per day, week, month, or on specific dates, who have installed your mobile app on their phones?  Yes\n\nHow about offline notifications?: Does Beiwe deliver local operating system notifications, where an end user receives notifications in their mobile device’s notification bar at scheduled times? (This is distinct from push notifications, which require an internet connection at the time that the notification is to be received, and from simple in-app notifications, which require the end user to be using the app to see their notifications.) Our survey scheduling system is in the process of being updated, I’ll have to ask our developers about this.\n\nIf a user taps on the push notification, will it take the user directly to the questionnaire to which they were assigned for that time? Yes\nIf yes to the above:\n\nWhere can I find a list of features (customizing mobile questionnaires, user response options, conditional logic, etc.)?\nSee page 3 of attached research administration manual\n\nHow do I score/visualize/analyze data?\nAll scoring/visualizing/analyzing of survey data is done by your team, you will receive the raw data which looks like this: https://github.com/onnela-lab/beiwe/wiki/Active-Data\n\nDo you have a privacy policy?\nYes: https://github.com/onnela-lab/beiwe/wiki/Beiwe-Data-Privacy-and-Security\n\nAre data encrypted on the phone or on your servers?\nYes, see this for more information: https://github.com/onnela-lab/beiwe/wiki/Beiwe-Data-Privacy-and-Security\n\nCould anyone on your end potentially view any (even anonymized) response data? Yes, if you have access to the study you can download the data.\n\nCan respondents delete data they've submitted, or can I delete respondents' data from your servers?\nNo, on Androids they can see their survey submissions but they cannot delete any of their data\n\nIf a researcher wishes to delete a participant's data, can they do it through a UI? Not at this time.\n\nCan users respond offline?\nYes, they will receive the survey and it will upload once they have a Wi-Fi or cellular data connection\n\nDoes Beiwe permit localization / languages?\nWe have Unicode support but all hardcoded language is exclusively in English.\n\nIs the admin/form builder interface in any languages other than English? No, the website and the hardcoded language on the app are only in English.\"\n\n11/2/2020 email: \"Thank you for your Beiwe inquiry on our Google Form. I’ll provide you with some information on the Beiwe Service Center (BSC) to get the ball rolling. For BSC, we would run your study on the same production software where we run our own studies, so it’s always the latest version and we run it on our lab’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. To give you a snapshot of how it would work, we will set up a study for you with the passive data settings that make sense for your study and give you a login to your study on the Beiwe backend, as well as to any RAs or collaborators that you request to be added to your study (max 5 logins). From there, you can enter any survey questions if you plan to use them. The backend is also where you’ll generate “Patient IDs” for your study participants. Currently, the Beiwe app is available on the app store for Apple iOS users and on the Google Play Store for Android users. To see if Beiwe makes sense for you, please take a look at our wiki: https://github.com/onnela-lab/beiwe/wiki In particular, the sensors we support are here: https://github.com/onnela-lab/beiwe/wiki/Supported-Data-Streams Our arrangement includes having you sign an Memorandum of Understanding which provides the software “as is” and asks for your IRB protocol and approval. Currently, the Beiwe pricing is based on three things: How many study participants you plan to enroll (N) How long you collect data for each study participant (t in months) How long you expect this research to last (T in months) I.E. The time from enrollment of the first participant to finish of data collection on last enrolled study participant, this includes any additional time needed for study admin and data download.\"",

This is done by using a QR Code. After coupling a user to a study, the study design will be synchronized to the smartphone of the user and the study will run. Regarding your questions: Do you want to send messages to the users, or do you want to remind them to enter data? The second one should be done automatically by the design of the study. Data collected from the users is stored on our server an can be downloaded as Excel file. The platform offers you the possibility to monitor the compliance of the users in the study.

We are working to update https://docs.lamp.digital/21db12cc01ce4138bed256fa0ba54194​to reflect its full capabilities.\n\n> Regarding MindLAMP's EMA/EMI capabilities, does this fully overlap with MindLogger as a way for people to create their own questionnaires through a browser-based interface, schedule recurrent push notifications to users' phones to alert them to fill out these questionnaires possibly multiple times per day, and to collect and visualize incoming data?  If so, are users expected to set this up on their own servers, or can they do all of the above on yours?    \n\nYes, we overlap in all those features. It is possible to do this via deployment on our servers or someone else's. We also do a lot more but certainly everything you have listed.  \n\n> For a manuscript I am submitting, I am almost done putting together a table comparing the current landscape of mobile EMA/EMI platforms out there that I hope will be of general interest.

      "contact": "11/5/2020 email: \"previous question -- what kind of in-app notifications are possible?  Offline, local OS notifications?\nPush (IOS/Android)  and in App notification shown from “site” in the chat conversation.\n\nIf you tap on a notification, does it take you directly to your scheduled questionnaire?\nToday we only send questionnaire notifications as email and sms. Will be implemented in future release.\n\nWhen setting up a question for an end-user, can I add pictures, an audio or video clip, a timer/countdown, conditional logic?\nConditional logic for open/closing questions etc is implemented in the ePRO system. It is possible to add pictures, but the solution can be improved.  \n\nDo you have a consumer-facing API?\nWe have no API for external parties to interact with our system. We have performed proof of concept integrations with wearable technology such as the Fitbit framework and are welcoming new initiatives.\n\nCan I assign reviewers to view particular users' data and noone else's?\nA member of a site (doctor, nurse etc) can view all site participants data.   \n\nCan more than one user access the app on a single phone?\nYes, login is with username and password. Not recommended because when you login to a phone that phone will be registered to that participant for push notifications. \nFor entering data on a device used by multiple users we would recommend the web browser version of ePRO.\n\nCan someone set up your system on their own server?\nWe don’t offer that service today. IT operation is performed by Complior (a group company with Replior) and is complying to security standards in PCI DSS, ISO 27001 and HIPAA\n\nIs the study control/admin panel + end-user app (notification messages, etc.) in languages other than English?\nThe admin application is in English only. All participant facing information (questionnaires/info/logbooks/notifications etc ) is multi-language. System generated dialogues in the App are translated to 16 languages currently. More translations will be added upon request.\"\n\n10/29/2020 email:\n\nQuestion: Where can I find a full list of features (customizing mobile questionnaires, user response options, etc.)?\n\nAnswer:\n\nYou can configure features like: Title, Description, Numbering style, Completed questionarie message, Scoring, Layout type, Drop down, Single Input, Radio button grid, Simple text block etc.\n \nBy \"text block\" do you mean users read a text block or enter text?\nUsers read a text.\n\nQuestion: How do I schedule push notifications to 1,000s of otherwise anonymous users enrolled in a study who have installed your mobile app on their phones?\n\nAnswer: First the patients have to be enrolled is the study (added to the system) and have been given access to the ePro app and the specific study. The system is a clinical trial system where each patient has a timeline that support visits, questionnaires or logbook/diary entries. The reminders/notifications are in most cases automatic based on the timeline. You also have an option to select a group of patients, or all patients, to send a message or notification to.\n\nAnonymity in the system is ensured where phone number and e-mail are entered by the site personnel who already know the patients identity anyway.\n\nYou can configure a timeslot for questionnaire entry at a specific time window for a patient, example day 10 +/- 3 days, and then set a grace-period of for example 4 days. Reminders can be configured to be sent when the questionaries entry period start and if its not responded to go out when the grace period start.\n\nHow are these notifications/reminders sent to the participants?  By push notifications, in-app notifications, SMS, or otherwise?\n\nConfigurable to send via all methods. In-app is standard, free of charge and total anonymous. E-mail is free of charge, require e-mail address. SMS will cost an additional fee per SMS sent and require phone number.\n\nQuestion: How do I score/visualize/analyze data?\n\nAnswer: Scoring is configured for the response alternatives when building the questionarie.\n\nDuring the study progress is displayed in a dashboard on study, country or site level. The data can be exported in XML or CSV, for analysis in SAS or Excel.\n\nQuestion: How long can I keep collecting and storing data?  Are there data quotas?\n\nAnswer: We apply a monthly fee. Data can be collected for as long as the study is in progress, and be kept on the servers for two months after Last Patient Out.\n\nQuestion: Would I pay for an admin license and would the 1,000s of study participants access the mobile app for free?\n\nAnswer: You as sponsor of the study will pay a server set-up fee and a monthly software license. An additional fee per SMS sent will be applied if you select SMS messages.\nThe monthly fee is based on the number of questionnaires, the number of sites and number of patients. The usage of the app is included.\n\nQuestion: Do you have a privacy policy?\n\nAnswer: Yes, we have. https://www.trialonline.se/privacy-policy/\n\nQuestion: Are data encrypted on the phone or on your servers?\n\nAnswer: Data is encrypted on the servers, as well as the transmission via mobile phone/data network. No data is stored on the phone.\n\nWhat I meant by this was: are data on the phone encrypted on the phone before they are sent to the server, so that noone at your company can see/decrypt their data?\n\nNo, the data is not encrypted on the phone.",

      "contact": "\"At the moment, SurveyCTO Collect, our mobile data collection app for Android and iOS, does not support push notifications for scheduled questionnaires. However, you can use the auto-download and auto-install form updates options to ensure that when surveys are updated on the server, users will be notified within the app (if they are online). If you enable the option to show send/receive status at the top of the main menu, that will also have a Refresh button users can press to manually check for updates. Newly deployed surveys on the server require users to use the Get Blank Form option to select and download the survey. Does this help to answer your question? I should also add that SurveyCTO offers great flexibility for interoperability with other tools and platforms. And therefore, depending on the structure of your survey workflow, there are a few other options that you can use. For example, you can use our integrations with Google Sheets and Zapier to configure automated calendar reminders, SMS reminders, or even email reminders to a large group of individuals. Please see this great example of a similar set up from one of our users.\" \"  Earlier email: \"\"Yes, with SurveyCTO once you deploy your questionnaire on the server you can use that form to fill as many surveys as you want. Similarly, with push notification, if you mean to assign a case to a particular user and providing the list of cases they need to attend then yes, with the case management feature you can manage that as well. For your question about data visualization, yes, SurveyCTO's built-in Data Explorer allows for real-time data review and visualization in aggregate as well as at the individual survey submission level. Using the Data Explorer, users can easily summarize data submitted for individual fields, summarize the empirical relationships between fields, and drill down to browse individual submissions within their server. Users can also create custom reports using the third party integrations that SurveyCTO supports, with platforms such as Google Sheets. By setting up data publishing for specific fields in the surveys, incoming data can be automatically published into Google sheets reports or other platforms.\"",

Not currently, but we can build a customized version of the app to do this for your study. > 2. If I were to store data on your servers, How long can I keep storing data after my study is done?  Are there data quotas? See https://getodk.org/#odk-cloud for our very high storage quotas. If you are not capturing images/audio/video, you are unlikely to run into these quotas. You can keep the data for as long as you pay for our hosting. You can also export the data in an Excel or CSV form and store it on your own machines. > 3. Would I pay for an admin license and would the 1,000s of study participants access the mobile app for free? You can have as many users/participants/devices as you'd like for free. We price based on active projects, monthly submissions, and total storage. > 4. Do you have a privacy policy? Yes, see https://getodk.org/legal/privacy.html > 7. Are data encrypted on the phone or on your servers? Yes, data can be encrypted on the device, in transit, and at rest. See https://docs.getodk.org/central-encryption for more. > 8. Can respondents delete data they've submitted, or can I delete respondents' data from your servers? Respondents cannot delete their submissions and neither can you (although this feature is shipping soon).

It will be like if you need to send a notification now - just use the \"Broadcast Message\" feature. Please refer to the attached image.\n\nHow do I score/visualize/analyze data? - You can score/visualize/analyze data in the admin site of GoSurvey. You can set the scores per options for the single choice questions like radio grid, radio options and 5 star questions only - https://www.gosurvey.in/guide/getting-started/how-to-configure-scoring \nIn GoSurvey's Analytics section you can view and analyze data - https://www.gosurvey.in/guide/reports/view-analytical-reports  \n\nHow long can I keep collecting and storing data?  Are there data quotas? - You can keep collecting and storing data till your subscription duration expires. There aren't any data quotas.   \n\nWould I pay for an admin license and would the 1,000s of study participants access the mobile app for free? - To use GoSurvey on multiple devices, you will have to purchase the required number of device licenses. For eg. Given the 1000 participants are data collectors using the GoSurvey app in their respective devices then their additional device licenses have to be purchased. \n \nDo you have a privacy policy? - Yes. Privacy Policy Link - https://www.gosurvey.in/privacy-policy\n\nCan respondents delete data they've submitted, or can I delete respondents' data from your servers? - For you to delete unwanted or dummy responses, you can either enable the deletion option in advance or reach out to the support or sales team whenever you want to delete responses. Whoever has the access to the admin site then can delete the responses.\n\"",

Our mobile platform does utilize push notifications as well as email notifications. However, at this time, we do not expose or market the survey engine itself for creation of custom surveys - it is currently a tool only internal staff use to create custom surveys and publish them to our customers as part of a full service offering (as opposed to a self service offering such as qualtrix, survey monkey, etc). Our platform stores the results of the surveys and provides an excel export file with the results.  For surveys which have “scoring” , we have visual results for progress over time for a given participant. We have all of the technical abilities in our platform, but the only way we could meet your needs would be if we did all of the configuring of the custom surveys and the scheduling of when they are sent out to participants.  Even though we have “out of the box” surveys which allow clinicians to use our platform with ease, we also work with clinics who are involved in research who need a full service offering.  We quote each project based on specific needs, and can do so if you wish to discuss further.\"",

The guideline recommendations have been developed by a multidisciplinary group of healthcare professionals, patients and their representatives, and researchers after careful consideration of the best available evidence. It is intended that the guideline will be useful to clinicians and service commissioners in providing and planning high quality care for those people who self-harm while also emphasising the importance of the experience of care for service users and carers."
