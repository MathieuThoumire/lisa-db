Social deviance or conflict alone, without personal dysfunction, should not be included in mental disorder as defined here. [International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems of Mental and Behavioral Disorders Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines, 1994, https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf]\n\nA mental disorder is a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual’s cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress or disability in social, occupational, or other important activities. An expectable or culturally approved response to a common stressor or loss, such as the death of a loved one, is not a mental disorder. Socially deviant behavior (e.g., political, religious, or sexual) and conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are not mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict results from a dysfunction in the individual, as described above. [DSM-5, 2013, American Psychiatric Association]\n\nA mental disorder, also called a mental illness[2] or psychiatric disorder, is a behavioral or mental pattern that causes significant distress or impairment of personal functioning.[3] Such features may be persistent, relapsing and remitting, or occur as a single episode. Many disorders have been described, with signs and symptoms that vary widely between specific disorders.[4][5] Such disorders may be diagnosed by a mental health professional.

[schema:MedicalCode, https://schema.org/MedicalCode]\n\nIn health care, diagnosis codes are used as a tool to group and identify diseases, disorders, symptoms, poisonings, adverse effects of drugs and chemicals, injuries and other reasons for patient encounters. Diagnostic coding is the translation of written descriptions of diseases, illnesses and injuries into codes from a particular classification. In medical classification, diagnosis codes are used as part of the clinical coding process alongside intervention codes. Both diagnosis and intervention codes are assigned by a health professional trained in medical classification such as a clinical coder or Health Information Manager.[1] Several diagnosis classification systems have been implemented to various degrees of success across the world. The various classifications have a focus towards a particular patient encounter type such as emergency, inpatient, outpatient, mental health as well as surgical care. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) is one of the most widely used classification systems for diagnosis coding as it allows comparability and use of mortality and morbidity data.[2] [Wikipedia \"Diagnostic code\": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis_code]\n\nEach disorder is accompanied by an identifying diagnostic and statistical code, which is typically used by institutions and agencies for data collection and billing purposes. There are specific recording protocols for these diagnostic codes (identified as coding notes in the text) that were established by WHO, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics to ensure consistent international recording of prevalence and mortality rates for identified health conditions. For most clinicians, the codes are used to identify the diagnosis or reason for visit for CMS and private insurance service claims.

      "definition": "Specifiers are extensions to a diagnosis to further clarify a disorder or illness.[1] They allow for a more specific diagnosis. They are used extensively in the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) primarily in the diagnosis of mood disorders. Specifiers are not mutually exclusive and more than one specifier may be applied on a patient.[2] [Wikipedia \"Specifier\": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specifier_(psychology)]\n\nSubtypes and specifiers (some of which are coded in the fourth, fifth, or sixth digit) are provided for increased specificity. Subtypes define mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive phenomenological subgroupings within a diagnosis and are indicated by the instruction “Specify whether” in the criteria set. In contrast, specifiers are not intended to be mutually exclusive or jointly exhaustive, and as a consequence, more than one specifier may be given. Specifiers are indicated by the instruction “Specify” or “Specify if” in the criteria set. Specifiers provide an opportunity to define a more homogeneous subgrouping of individuals with the disorder who share certain features (e.g., major depressive disorder, with mixed features) and to convey information that is relevant to the management of the individual’s disorder, such as the “with other medical comorbidity” specifier in sleep-wake disorders. Although a fifth digit is sometimes assigned to code a subtype or specifier (e.g., 294.11 [F02.81] major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, with behavioral disturbance) or severity (296.21 [F32.0] major depressive disorder, single episode, mild), the majority of subtypes and specifiers included in DSM-5 cannot be coded within the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM systems and are indicated only by including the subtype or specifier after the name of the disorder (e.g., social anxiety disorder [social phobia], performance type). Note that in some cases, a specifier or subtype is codable in ICD-10-CM but not in ICD-9-CM. Accordingly, in some cases the 4th or 5th character codes for the subtypes or specifiers are provided only for the ICD-10-CM coding designations.
